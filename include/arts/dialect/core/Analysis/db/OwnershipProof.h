/// Proof-driven ownership analysis for lowering contracts.
///
/// Computes a 5-dimension proof vector that certifies various aspects of
/// ownership soundness for a distributed kernel:
///   - ownerDimReachability: owner dims are statically reachable
///   - partitionAccessMapping: partition-to-access mapping is sound
///   - haloLegality: halo widening is legal
///   - depSliceSoundness: dependency narrowing is sound
///   - relaunchStateSoundness: relaunch state is stable
///
/// When all 5 dimensions are proven, downstream passes can trust the
/// contract's spatial layout without re-deriving evidence from the graph.
