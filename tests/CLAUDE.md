# tests/ — Test Suites

## Directory Layout

```
cli/               CLI flag validation tests
verify/            Verification barrier pass tests
inputs/            Shared test input files (configs, snapshots)
```

Pass-level lit tests are co-located with source code:
```
lib/arts/dialect/sde/test/   Semantic (SDE) dialect tests (stages 1-3)
lib/arts/dialect/core/test/  ARTS core dialect tests (stages 4-15)
  partitioning/              DB partitioning contract tests (modes/ + safety/)
lib/arts/dialect/rt/test/    Runtime dialect tests (stage 16 + epilogues)
```

Demo programs live at the project root:
```
samples/           End-to-end C/C++ demo programs (moved from tests/examples/)
```
